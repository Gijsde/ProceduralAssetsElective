# Procedural Assets Elective
this project was made for an elective I took at school called procedural assets.
For this elective I Tried to procedurally generate mountains.
The user can upload an image of an outline of a moutain. The program will then clean up the image and generate the heightmap based on the specifications given by the user.
The program makes use of certain functions (Like smoothstep or linear). The user is able to choose between functions for certain steps of the generation, it should also be reasonably easy to add new functions in Functions.java.

Mountain terminology:
1. Spurs: these are the ridges/lines a mountain has.
